Version 1.0.5.5
-Features
-- I added a "Truly Random" Grab Type which feeds off of /r/subreddit/random. Meaning no strings attached. Seams to only work well with Picture "mostly" subreddits.

-Bug Fixes
-- I fixed some programing freezing/holding when setting a new wallpaper. Now you can freely change settings while it is still setting a new wallpaper.
