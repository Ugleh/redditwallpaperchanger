Reddit Wallpaper Changer
==========
RWC is a Standalone Wallpaper Rotator that uses Reddit as its hunting ground. Reddit Wallpaper Changer lets you use different subreddits or even Multi Reddits as well as your own search queries to thin out the results (personally I go with wallpaper+wallpapers and a query of "1920 x 1080").

RWC has Imgur Album support as well as Deviant Art link support. More support added regularly, all you have to do is go to the subreddit link below and contact me asking for it.
